Use local LLMs in your browser and Node.js apps. This package is designed to patch `OpenAI` and `Anthropic` clients for running inference locally, using predictors hosted on [Function](https://fxn.ai/explore).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This package is still a work-in-progress, so the API could change drastically between **all** releases.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never embed access keys client-side (i.e. in the browser)**. Instead, create a proxy URL in your backend.

## Installing Function LLM
Function LLM is distributed on NPM. Open a terminal and run the following command:
```bash
$ npm install fxn-llm
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to create an access key by signing onto [Function](https://fxn.ai/settings/developer). You'll need it to fetch the predictor at runtime.

## Using the OpenAI Client Locally
To run text generation and embedding models locally using the OpenAI client, patch your `OpenAI` instance with the `locally` function:
```ts
import { locally } from "fxn-llm"
import { OpenAI } from "openai"

// ðŸ’¥ Create your OpenAI client
let openai = new OpenAI();

// ðŸ”¥ Make it local
openai = locally(openai);

// ðŸš€ Generate embeddings
const embeddings = openai.embeddings.create({
  model: "@nomic/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-quant",
  input: "search_query: Hello world!"
});
```

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, only `openai.embeddings.create` is supported. Text generation is coming soon!

## Using the Anthropic Client Locally
To run text generation models locally using the Anthopic client, patch your `Anthropic` instance with the `locally` function and the following configuration:
```js
import { locally } from "fxn-llm"
import { Anthropic } from "@anthropic-ai/sdk"

// ðŸ’¥ Create your Anthropic client
let anthropic = new Anthropic();

// ðŸ”¥ Make it local
anthropic = locally(openai);

// ðŸš€ Chat
const message = anthropic.messages.create({
  model: "@meta/llama-3.1-8b-quant",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello, Llama" }],
  max_tokens: 1024,
});
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Anthropic support is not functional. It is still a work-in-progress.
